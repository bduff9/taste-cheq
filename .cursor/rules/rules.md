# TasteCheq UI & TypeScript Coding Rule

- Use shadcn/ui components for all UI elements (e.g., Button, Input, Card, etc.).
- Use `const` arrow functions for all React components and event handlers.
- Prefer `type` aliases over `interface` for TypeScript types unless interface extension is required.
- All client components must have a Storybook story demonstrating their variants and usage.
- Remove or refactor any legacy, demo, or custom UI components that do not follow these rules.
